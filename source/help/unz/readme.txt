NOTES
=====

1. The unzip code (unzip.* and ioapi.*) was created by
Gilles Vollant, see unzip.c for conditions of use and
distribution. Note that this is a slimmed down version
of the Gilles Vollant's minizip code.

2. To compile, you need the zlib library:

http://www.zlib.org 
or
http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

The zlib library should be built for DOS large memory model,
and to suit your compiler.

A version suitable for Borland Turbo C++ 3.1 for DOS (and other
Borland compilers) has been prepared and can be downloaded from the
project website:
